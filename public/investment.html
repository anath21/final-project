            <p>
                An investment property is real estate purchased to generate passive 
                income (earn a return on the investment) through rental income or 
                appreciation. Investment properties are typically purchased by a 
                single investor or a pair or group of real estate investors.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are several types of investment properties investors can buy to earn passive income. Below are some of the most common.
            </p>

            <h2>Residential Real Estate</h2>
            <p>
                The most common type of investment property is residential real estate. The properties are for occupancy, like single-family homes, condominiums and apartments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Real estate investors tend to prefer residential real estate because, once you secure a high-value property and long-term tenants live there, it can generate reliable income. However, the start-up costs are high, and you may wait for some time before cash starts flowing in.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to sell the property and there are tenants in the building, that can slow the sale while property prices rise.
            </p>
            <h2>Commercial Real Estate</h2>
            <p>
                Properties you can live in aren’t the only available investment properties. People also need offices to work, hotels to stay in, retail stores to shop in and restaurants to eat at. Like a residential real estate investment, a commercial real estate investment collects income from renting out a space to tenants or selling it once the property’s value appreciates.

                As with residential properties, selling a property with tenants in place can slow down a sale while property prices go up.
